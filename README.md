Suko is a delightful puzzle game that will challenge your number skills!

In Suko, you get to play on a cozy 3x3 grid. Your mission? Well, it's all about arranging the numbers 1 to 9 in such a way that everyone's happy.

To solve puzzles by meeting certain rules:
 - Each white circle has a number, and the sum of the four boxes around it should be equal to that number.
 - Plus, there's a colorful twist! The boxes with colors should also add up to match the total for each respective color (circle below).
