***Updated Feature(s)**: Generator `Diceüé≤` (generate a new set each time); Checker (check your try out); Cleanser `Clear üßπÔ∏è` (clear all the Grid box input excluding circled numbers); Solver (solve it by AI with zero effort); *Three levels of difficulty* induced in the latest version.

**Bot/AI's answer (via `Solveü§ñ`) is not a unique answer if any other possibilities exist, please use the `ChecküßÆÔ∏è` button to check your inputted answer (it will calculate according to your input and not merely compare straight to the AI's output).

Suko is a delightful puzzle game that will challenge your number skills!

In Suko, you get to play on a cozy 3x3 grid. Your mission? Well, it's all about arranging the numbers 1 to 9 in such a way that everyone's happy.

To solve puzzles by meeting certain rules:
 - Each white circle has a number, and the sum of the four boxes around it should be equal to that number.
 - Plus, there's a colorful twist! The boxes with colors should also add up to match the total for each respective color (circle below).
